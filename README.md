# BOSDraft
Shiny app for managing a fantasy baseball draft

Players are "drafted" onto fantasy teams from a master data table of American League hitters and pitchers.
The data includes the player's name, team, positions, and projected stats for the season. In addition to 
the list of players, there is a tab showing all AL team rosters, another tab that shows all fantasy team
rosters, and tabs showing each individual fantasy team roster with stats for each player. Another tab
then shows the projected league standings based on the projected stats.
